# big-schoolwork-repo

**a repo which i use to do my cs or just general coding stuff at school with. as it is set up with a codespace so i can use vs code and some cool packages**

**i have tried my best to keep it nicely sorted but this will eventually be a shithole of random scripts in the wrong place. but so far so good.**
