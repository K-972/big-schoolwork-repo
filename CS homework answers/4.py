A recursive case: In the recursive algorithm, the problem is broken down into smaller, similar subproblems.
Convergence towards the base case: Each recursive call should move the problem closer to the base case."""

Advantages and disadvantages of iterative and recursive routines:
Advantages of iterative routines:
They are often more memory-efficient.
They are generally faster and have lower overhead.
They are easier to understand and implement for some problems.
Disadvantages of iterative routines:
They may require more code for certain problems.
They can be less elegant and intuitive for problems that naturally have a recursive structure.
Advantages of recursive routines:
They can be more elegant and intuitive for problems with a recursive structure. -
They may require less code for certain problems. -
They can simplify complex problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems. -
Disadvantages of recursive routines:
They can be less memory-efficient due to the function call stack. - Stack Overflow
